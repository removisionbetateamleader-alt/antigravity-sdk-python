r"""Example demonstrating streaming with the Agent API.

The Agent.chat() method returns a ChatResponse that can be async-iterated to
stream text deltas as they arrive from the model:

  response = await agent.chat("Write a poem.")
  async for delta in response:
      sys.stdout.write(delta)

ChatResponse also exposes `.thoughts`, `.tool_calls`, and `.chunks` iterators
for advanced use cases — see the module docstring on ChatResponse for details.

To run:
  python3 streaming_content_example.py
